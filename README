## Project Description
ToDoAplication is a simple task manager written in C# using WPF and the MVVM pattern. The project aims to facilitate basic CRUD operations on tasks and organization through categories and archiving.

## Features (current)
- Creating, editing, and deleting tasks (CRUD).
- Task archiving – moving tasks to the archive, the ability to delete them from the archive, and restoring them to the main view.
- Detail view (Description) for a single task – adding/editing a description.
- Checkboxes and simple flags on tasks (e.g., marking completion).

- Simple input validations and basic error handling.

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Nefil/ToDoAplication.git

2. Open the `ToDoAplication.sln` solution in Visual Studio (or another IDE that supports WPF).

3. Restore NuGet packages:
- Visual Studio: Build → Restore NuGet Packages
- or: dotnet restore in the solution directory

4. Build and run the project (Build → Build Solution → Start).

## Usage (briefly)
- Run the application.
- Create a new task and give it a title.
- Click the task to select it; click the description button to add/edit the Description.
- Set the checkboxes corresponding to the task's status (e.g., completed/important).
- Archive tasks when they are no longer active; review and restore them from the archive as needed. Requirements and Environment
- Operating System: Windows (WPF)
- .NET SDK: Check `ToDoAplication/ToDoAplication.csproj` to determine the Target Framework (recommended: .NET 6.0 LTS or .NET 7.0)
- IDE: Visual Studio 2022 / Rider / other with WPF support

## Proposed Improvements (briefly)
- Full CRUD for categories and filtering by category.
- Expanded Description/Details view: notes, change history, attachments.
- Task export/import (JSON/CSV).
- Multilingual support (resx) and UI themes (dark/light).
