# ToDoAplication (In development)

## Project description

ToDoAplication is a WPF desktop application written in C#. The app allows you to create, edit and delete to‑do items. This development version introduces two important features: task categorization and the ability to view detailed information for each record in a "Details" view.

## Features

- Create, edit and delete tasks (CRUD)
- Simple, responsive WPF user interface
- Input validation and basic error handling

## Technologies

- C# (.NET)
- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- MVVM

## Installation and running

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Nefil/ToDoAplication.git
2. Open the solution (ToDoAplication.sln) in Visual Studio.
3. Restore NuGet packages (Build → Restore NuGet Packages).
4. Build and run the application.

## Usage example (Not all options are available yet)

- Start the application.
- Add a few categories (e.g. Work, Home, Hobby).
- Create a new task and assign it to a chosen category.
- Use the task list filter to show only tasks from a given category.
- Click a task to open the "Details" view — view full information, edit or delete the record.

## Future enhancements

- Task categorization
  - Add the ability to create and manage categories (e.g. Work, Home, Shopping).
  - Filter the task list by category and other criteria (e.g. status, priority).
  - Each task can be assigned to one category.
  - Provide filtering and sorting of the task list by category.
- Task details view (Details)
  - Open a single task and view all fields (title, description, created date, due date, priority, category, notes).
  - Edit and delete directly from the details view.
  - Possible extensions: change history, attachments, comments.
- Create a SQLite database that persists all Details fields
  - Implement a local SQLite database using Entity Framework Core.
  - Models should reflect all fields available in the Details view (for example: Title, Description, CreatedAt, DueDate, Priority, IsCompleted, CategoryId, Notes, AttachmentPaths, etc.).
  - Add EF Core migrations and initialize the database on application startup (e.g. Database.Migrate() or EnsureCreated()).
  - Use a safe writable path for the database file (for example, a folder inside %APPDATA% specific to the application) and ensure the folder is created automatically.
  - Ensure CRUD operations call SaveChanges / SaveChangesAsync so data is persisted.
  - Add integration tests using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory or run tests against a real SQLite file.
- Unit tests
